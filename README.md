# yaleMathDepartmentShirt
Katherine Xiu's (Yale '18) beautiful design for the 2018 Yale Math Department shirts.
230 shirts with this design were printed and distributed to members of the Yale Math Department community by YUMS, the Yale Undergraduate Math Society.
The design illustrates the mathematical "pigeonhole principle".
